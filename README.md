# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains basic implementations of data structures and algorithms. It's perfect for learning and practicing coding concepts.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Store elements in a contiguous block of memory.
- **Linked Lists**: Nodes connected by pointers.
- **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
- **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structure.
- **Graphs**: Nodes connected by edges.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking problems into simpler subproblems.
- **Greedy**: Making the best choice at each step.
- **Recursion**: Functions that call themselves.
